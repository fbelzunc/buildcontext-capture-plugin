        If this option is checked, Jenkins makes it possible to capture the build context. <br/>
        BuildContext plugin enables users to record all build configurations
        (jenkins infrastructure information, build time, job configuration file, environment variables, build log, any generic information computed by a script).
        The plugin was born from the config record feature provided in the Clearcase VCS.
